### Hey there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I’m [**Florian**](https://heyoptima.de), a fullstack software engineer based in Germany.

I build whatever I can envision.

If an idea pops into my head, chances are I’ll build it and tell you about it.

My main tech stack is java, angular, spring boot, typescript, and tailwind. My favorite tools are neovim, git and excalidraw.

I’ve built too many public repos, but privately.. it’s probably more than 150 at this point.

#### Fun Facts:

* I drink at most one coffee a day
* I have a lovely cat
* **Hobbies:** triathlon, gym, building things
